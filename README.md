# Earworm
A sound sampling app for the Dare Mighty Things Hackathon 2019.
Check out the original repo for the full member list, all of them deserve a ton of credit. 

Todo List:
* Changing the default file of the recordings from .caf to something like .mp3 for IOS.
* Adding a detailed playback function, the components are there (check unused folder) but I need to update the front-end 
* Instead of having to save the recording first, have the recording auto convert to a sound that can be edited, that is then saved.
* Possily have a 'sample playground', I.E add samples to samples to create a new sample.
